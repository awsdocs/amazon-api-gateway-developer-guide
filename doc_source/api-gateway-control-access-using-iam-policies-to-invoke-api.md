# Control access for invoking an API<a name="api-gateway-control-access-using-iam-policies-to-invoke-api"></a>

 In this section you will learn how to write up IAM policy statements to control who can call a deployed API in API Gateway\. Here, you will also find the policy statement reference, including the formats of `Action` and `Resource` fields related to the API execution service\. You should also study the IAM section in [How API Gateway resource policies affect authorization workflow](apigateway-authorization-flow.md)\.

For private APIs, you should use a combination of an API Gateway resource policy and a VPC endpoint policy\. For more information, see the following topics:
+ [Controlling access to an API with API Gateway resource policies](apigateway-resource-policies.md)
+ [Use VPC endpoint policies for private APIs in API Gateway](apigateway-vpc-endpoint-policies.md)

## Control who can call an API Gateway API method with IAM policies<a name="api-gateway-who-can-invoke-an-api-method-using-iam-policies"></a>

 To control who can or cannot call a deployed API with IAM permissions, create an IAM policy document with required permissions\. A template for such a policy document is shown as follows\. 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Permission",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Execution-operation"           
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage/METHOD_HTTP_VERB/Resource-path"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

 Here, `Permission` is to be replaced by `Allow` or `Deny` depending on whether you want to grant or revoke the included permissions\. `Execution-operation` is to be replaced by the operations supported by the API execution service\. `METHOD_HTTP_VERB` stands for a HTTP verb supported by the specified resources\. `Resource-path` is the placeholder for the URL path of a deployed API `[Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Resource.html)` instance supporting the said `METHOD_HTTP_VERB`\. For more information, see [Statement reference of IAM policies for executing API in API Gateway](#api-gateway-calling-api-permissions)\. 

**Note**  
For IAM policies to be effective, you must have enabled IAM authentication on API methods by setting `AWS_IAM` for the methods' `[authorizationType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Method.html#authorizationType)` property\. Failing to do so will make these API methods publicly accessible\.

 For example, to grant a user permission to view a list of pets exposed by a specified API, but to deny the user permission to add a pet to the list, you could include the following statement in the IAM policy: 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Invoke"           
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:account-id:api-id/*/GET/pets"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Invoke"           
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:account-id:api-id/*/POST/pets"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To grant a user permission to view a specific pet exposed by an API that is configured as `GET /pets/{petId}`, you could include the following statement in the IAM policy:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Invoke"           
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:account-id:api-id/*/GET/pets/a1b2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Statement reference of IAM policies for executing API in API Gateway<a name="api-gateway-calling-api-permissions"></a>

The following information describes the Action and Resource format of IAM policy statements of access permissions for executing an API\.

### Action format of permissions for executing API in API Gateway<a name="api-gateway-iam-policy-action-format-for-executing-api"></a>

The API\-executing `Action` expression has the following general format:

```
execute-api:action
```

where *action* is an available API\-executing action:
+ **\***, which represents all of the following actions\.
+ **Invoke**, used to invoke an API upon a client request\.
+ **InvalidateCache**, used to invalidate API cache upon a client request\.

### Resource format of permissions for executing API in API Gateway<a name="api-gateway-iam-policy-resource-format-for-executing-api"></a>

The API\-executing `Resource` expression has the following general format:

```
arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage-name/HTTP-VERB/resource-path-specifier
```

where:
+ *region* is the AWS region \(such as **us\-east\-1** or **\*** for all AWS regions\) that corresponds to the deployed API for the method\.
+ *account\-id* is the 12\-digit AWS account Id of the REST API owner\. 
+ *api\-id* is the identifier API Gateway has assigned to the API for the method\.
+ *stage\-name* is the name of the stage associated with the method\.
+ *HTTP\-VERB* is the HTTP verb for the method\. It can be one of the following: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH\.
+ *resource\-path\-specifier* is the path to the desired method\.

Some example resource expressions include:
+ **arn:aws:execute\-api:\*:\*:\*** for any resource path in any stage, for any API in any AWS region\.
+ **arn:aws:execute\-api:us\-east\-1:\*:\*** for any resource path in any stage, for any API in the AWS region of `us-east-1`\.
+ **arn:aws:execute\-api:us\-east\-1:\*:*api\-id*/\*** for any resource path in any stage, for the API with the identifier of *api\-id* in the AWS region of us\-east\-1\.
+ **arn:aws:execute\-api:us\-east\-1:\*:*api\-id*/`test`/\*** for resource path in the stage of `test`, for the API with the identifier of *api\-id* in the AWS region of us\-east\-1\.

# Setting up a stage for a REST API<a name="set-up-stages"></a>

A stage is a named reference to a deployment, which is a snapshot of the API\. You use a [Stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/) to manage and optimize a particular deployment\. For example, you can configure stage settings to enable caching, customize request throttling, configure logging, define stage variables, or attach a canary release for testing\.

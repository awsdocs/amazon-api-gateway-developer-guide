# Amazon API Gateway REST API<a name="api-ref"></a>

 When you use the Amazon API Gateway console to create, configure, update, and deploy an API, the console calls the API Gateway REST API behind the scenes to make things happen\. 

 When you use AWS Command Line Interface to create, configure, update, and deploy an API, the AWS CLI tool calls the API Gateway REST API as well\. For an example, see [ Create an API using API Gateway and Test It](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-on-demand-https-example-configure-event-source.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide* \. For more information, see [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\.

When you use an [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) to create, configure, update, and deploy an API, the SDK calls the API Gateway REST API behind the scenes\.

 Instead, you can call the API Gateway REST API directly to create, configure, update, and deploy an API in API Gateway\. 

 For more information on how to use the API Gateway REST API, see [Amazon API Gateway REST API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/)\.

## I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole"></a>

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, then you must contact your administrator for assistance\. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your user name and password\. Ask that person to update your policies to allow you to pass a role to API Gateway\.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service, instead of creating a new service role or service\-linked role\. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service\.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in API Gateway\. However, the action requires the service to have permissions granted by a service role\. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service\.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary asks her administrator to update her policies to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action\.

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources\. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role\. For services that support resource\-based policies or access control lists \(ACLs\), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources\.

# Content type conversions in API Gateway<a name="api-gateway-payload-encodings-workflow"></a>

 The combination of your API's `binaryMediaTypes`, the headers in client requests, and the integration `contentHandling` property determine how API Gateway encodes payloads\.

The following table shows how API Gateway converts the request payload for specific configurations of a request's `Content-Type` header, the `binaryMediaTypes` list of a [RestApi](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_RestApi.html) resource, and the `contentHandling` property value of the [Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Integration.html) resource\.


**API request content type conversions in API Gateway**  

| Method request payload | Request `Content-Type` header | `binaryMediaTypes` | `contentHandling` | Integration request payload | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Text data | Any data type | Undefined | Undefined | UTF8\-encoded string | 
| Text data | Any data type | Undefined | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Base64\-decoded binary blob | 
| Text data | Any data type | Undefined | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | UTF8\-encoded string | 
| Text data | A text data type | Set with matching media types | Undefined | Text data | 
| Text data | A text data type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Base64\-decoded binary blob | 
| Text data | A text data type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | Text data | 
| Binary data | A binary data type | Set with matching media types | Undefined | Binary data | 
| Binary data | A binary data type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Binary data | 
| Binary data | A binary data type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | Base64\-encoded string | 

The following table shows how API Gateway converts the response payload for specific configurations of a request's `Accept` header, the `binaryMediaTypes` list of a [RestApi](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_RestApi.html) resource, and the `contentHandling` property value of the [IntegrationResponse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_IntegrationResponse.html) resource\.

**Important**  
 When a request contains multiple media types in its `Accept` header, API Gateway honors only the first `Accept` media type\. If you can't control the order of the `Accept` media types and the media type of your binary content isn't the first in the list, add the first `Accept` media type in the `binaryMediaTypes` list of your API\. API Gateway handles all content types in this list as binary\.   
For example, to send a JPEG file using an `<img>` element in a browser, the browser might send `Accept:image/webp,image/*,*/*;q=0.8` in a request\. By adding `image/webp` to the `binaryMediaTypes` list, the endpoint receives the JPEG file as binary\. 


**API Gateway response content type conversions**  

| Integration response payload | Request `Accept` header | `binaryMediaTypes` | `contentHandling` | Method response payload | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Text or binary data | A text type | Undefined | Undefined | UTF8\-encoded string | 
| Text or binary data | A text type | Undefined | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Base64\-decoded blob | 
| Text or binary data | A text type | Undefined | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | UTF8\-encoded string | 
| Text data | A text type | Set with matching media types | Undefined | Text data | 
| Text data | A text type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Base64\-decoded blob | 
| Text data | A text type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | UTF8\-encoded string | 
| Text data | A binary type | Set with matching media types | Undefined | Base64\-decoded blob | 
| Text data | A binary type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Base64\-decoded blob | 
| Text data | A binary type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | UTF8\-encoded string | 
| Binary data | A text type | Set with matching media types | Undefined | Base64\-encoded string | 
| Binary data | A text type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Binary data | 
| Binary data | A text type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | Base64\-encoded string | 
| Binary data | A binary type | Set with matching media types | Undefined | Binary data | 
| Binary data | A binary type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_BINARY | Binary data | 
| Binary data | A binary type | Set with matching media types | CONVERT\_TO\_TEXT | Base64\-encoded string | 

When converting a text payload to a binary blob, API Gateway assumes that the text data is a base64\-encoded string and outputs the binary data as a base64\-decoded blob\. If the conversion fails, it returns a `500` response, which indicates an API configuration error\. You don't provide a mapping template for such a conversion, although you must enable the [passthrough behaviors](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md) on the API\.

When converting a binary payload to a text string, API Gateway always applies a base64 encoding on the binary data\. You can define a mapping template for such a payload, but can only access the base64\-encoded string in the mapping template through `$input.body`, as shown in the following excerpt of an example mapping template\. 

```
{   
    "data": "$input.body"
}
```

To have the binary payload passed through without modification, you must enable the [passthrough behaviors](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md) on the API\.

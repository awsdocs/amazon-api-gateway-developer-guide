# Use generated iOS SDK \(Swift\) to call API<a name="how-to-generate-sdk-ios-swift"></a>

Before beginning the following procedure, you must complete the steps in [Generate SDKs for an API using the API Gateway console](how-to-generate-sdk-console.md) for iOS in Swift and download the \.zip file of the generated SDK\.

## Install AWS mobile SDK and API Gateway\-generated SDK in a Swift project<a name="use-sdk-ios-swift-install-sdk"></a>

The following procedure describes how to install the SDK\.

**To install and use an iOS SDK generated by API Gateway in Swift**

1. Extract the contents of the API Gateway\-generated \.zip file you downloaded earlier\. Using the [SimpleCalc API](simple-calc-lambda-api.md), you may want to rename the unzipped SDK folder to something like **sdk\_swift\_simple\_calc**\. In this SDK folder there is a `README.md` file and a `Podfile` file\. The `README.md` file contains the instructions to install and use the SDK\. This tutorial provides details about these instructions\. The installation leverages [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) to import required AWS Mobile SDK components\. You must update the `Podfile` to import the SDKs into your Swift app's Xcode project\. The unarchived SDK folder also contains a `generated-src` folder that contains the source code of the generated SDK of your API\.

1. Launch Xcode and create a new iOS Swift project\. Make a note of the project's target\. You will need to set it in the `Podfile`\.

1. To import the required AWS Mobile SDK components into the Xcode project by using CocoaPods, do the following:

   1. If it is not installed, install CocoaPods by running the following command in a terminal window:

      ```
      sudo gem install cocoapods
      pod setup
      ```

   1. Copy the `Podfile` file from the extracted SDK folder into the same directory containing your Xcode project file\. Replace the following block:

      ```
      target '<YourXcodeTarget>' do
          pod 'AWSAPIGateway', '~> 2.4.7'
      end
      ```

      with your project's target name as shown: 

      ```
      target 'app_swift_simple_calc' do
          pod 'AWSAPIGateway', '~> 2.4.7'
      end
      ```

      If your Xcode project already contains a `Podfile` with the correct target, you can simply add the following line of code to the `do ... end` loop:

      ```
      pod 'AWSAPIGateway', '~> 2.4.7'
      ```

   1. Open a terminal window and run the following command in the app directory:

      ```
      pod install
      ```

      This installs the API Gateway component and any dependent AWS Mobile SDK components into the app's project\.

   1. Close the Xcode project and then open the `*.xcworkspace` file to relaunch Xcode\.

   1. Add all of the SDK's header files \(`.h`\) and Swift source code files \(`.swift`\) from the extracted `generated-src` directory to your Xcode project\.

         
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/use-sdk-in-ios-swift-project-add-sdk-src.png)

   1. To enable calling the Objective\-C libraries of the AWS Mobile SDK from your Swift code project, set the `Bridging_Header.h` file path on the **Objective\-C Bridging Header** property under the **Swift Compiler \- General** setting of your Xcode project configuration: 

         
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/use-sdk-in-ios-swift-project-set-bridging-header.png)
**Tip**  
You can type **bridging** in the search box of Xcode to locate the **Objective\-C Bridging Header** property\.

   1. Build the Xcode project to verify that it is properly configured before proceeding further\. If your Xcode uses a more recent version of Swift than the one supported for the AWS Mobile SDK, you will get Swift compiler errors\. In this case, set the **Use Legacy Swift Language Version** property to **Yes** under the **Swift Compiler \- Version** setting:

         
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/use-sdk-in-ios-swift-project-set-legacy-swift-version.png)

   To import the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS in Swift into your project by explicitly downloading the AWS Mobile SDK or using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage), follow the instructions in the `README.md` file that comes with the SDK package\. Be sure to use only one of these options to import the AWS Mobile SDK\.

## Call API methods through the iOS SDK generated by API Gateway in a Swift project<a name="use-sdk-ios-swift-call-api"></a>

When you generated the SDK with the prefix of `SIMPLE_CALC` for this [SimpleCalc API](simple-calc-lambda-api.md) with two models to describe the input \(`Input`\) and output \(`Result`\) of the API's requests and responses, in the SDK, the resulting API client class becomes `SIMPLE_CALCSimpleCalcClient` and the corresponding data classes are `SIMPLE_CALCInput` and `SIMPLE_CALCResult`, respectively\. The API requests and responses are mapped to the SDK methods as follows: 
+ The API request of

  ```
  GET /?a=...&b=...&op=...
  ```

  becomes the SDK method of

  ```
  public func rootGet(op: String?, a: String?, b: String?) -> AWSTask
  ```

  The `AWSTask.result` property is of the `SIMPLE_CALCResult` type if the `Result` model was added to the method response\. Otherwise, it is of the `NSDictionary` type\.
+ This API request of

  ```
  POST /
      
  {
     "a": "Number",
     "b": "Number",
     "op": "String"
  }
  ```

  becomes the SDK method of

  ```
  public func rootPost(body: SIMPLE_CALCInput) -> AWSTask
  ```
+ The API request of

  ```
  GET /{a}/{b}/{op}
  ```

  becomes the SDK method of

  ```
  public func aBOpGet(a: String, b: String, op: String) -> AWSTask
  ```

The following procedure describes how to call the API methods in Swift app source code; for example, as part of the `viewDidLoad()` delegate in a `ViewController.m` file\.

**To call the API through the iOS SDK generated by API Gateway**

1. Instantiate the API client class:

   ```
   let client = SIMPLE_CALCSimpleCalcClient.default()
   ```

   To use Amazon Cognito with the API, set a default AWS service configuration \(shown following\) before getting the `default` method \(shown previously\):

   ```
   let credentialsProvider = AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider(regionType: AWSRegionType.USEast1, identityPoolId: "my_pool_id")        
   let configuration = AWSServiceConfiguration(region: AWSRegionType.USEast1, credentialsProvider: credentialsProvider)        
   AWSServiceManager.defaultServiceManager().defaultServiceConfiguration = configuration
   ```

1. Call the `GET /?a=1&b=2&op=+` method to perform `1+2`:

   ```
   client.rootGet("+", a: "1", b:"2").continueWithBlock {(task: AWSTask) -> AnyObject? in
       self.showResult(task)
       return nil
   }
   ```

   where the helper function `self.showResult(task)` prints the result or error to the console; for example: 

   ```
   func showResult(task: AWSTask) {
       if let error = task.error {
           print("Error: \(error)")
       } else if let result = task.result {
           if result is SIMPLE_CALCResult {
               let res = result as! SIMPLE_CALCResult
               print(String(format:"%@ %@ %@ = %@", res.input!.a!, res.input!.op!, res.input!.b!, res.output!.c!))
           } else if result is NSDictionary {
               let res = result as! NSDictionary
               print("NSDictionary: \(res)")
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   In a production app, you can display the result or error in a text field\. The resulting display is `1 + 2 = 3`\.

1. Call the `POST /` with a payload to perform `1-2`:

   ```
   let body = SIMPLE_CALCInput()
   body.a=1
   body.b=2
   body.op="-"
   client.rootPost(body).continueWithBlock {(task: AWSTask) -> AnyObject? in
       self.showResult(task)
       return nil
   }
   ```

   The resultant display is `1 - 2 = -1`\.

1. Call the `GET /{a}/{b}/{op}` to perform `1/2`:

   ```
   client.aBOpGet("1", b:"2", op:"div").continueWithBlock {(task: AWSTask) -> AnyObject? in
       self.showResult(task)
       return nil
   }
   ```

   The resulting display is `1 div 2 = 0.5`\. Here, `div` is used in place of `/` because the [simple Lambda function](simple-calc-nodejs-lambda-function.md) in the backend does not handle URL encoded path variables\.

# Working with binary media types for REST APIs<a name="api-gateway-payload-encodings"></a>

In API Gateway, the API request and response have a text or binary payload\. A text payload is a `UTF-8`\-encoded JSON string\. A binary payload is anything other than a text payload\. The binary payload can be, for example, a JPEG file, a GZip file, or an XML file\. The API configuration required to support binary media depends on whether your API uses proxy or non\-proxy integrations\.

## AWS Lambda proxy integrations<a name="api-gateway-payload-encodings-proxy"></a>

To handle binary payloads for AWS Lambda proxy integrations, you must base64\-encode your function's response\. You must also configure the [binaryMediaTypes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_RestApi.html#apigw-Type-RestApi-binaryMediaTypes) for your API\. Your API's `binaryMediaTypes` configuration is a list of content types that your API treats as binary data\. Example binary media types include `image/png` or `application/octet-stream`\. You can use the wildcard character \(`*`\) to cover multiple media types\. For example, `*/*` includes all content types\. 

For example code, see [Return binary media from a Lambda proxy integration](lambda-proxy-binary-media.md)\.

## Non\-proxy integrations<a name="api-gateway-payload-encodings-non-proxy"></a>

To handle binary payloads for non\-proxy integrations, you add the media types to the [binaryMediaTypes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_RestApi.html#apigw-Type-RestApi-binaryMediaTypes) list of the `RestApi` resource\. Your API's `binaryMediaTypes` configuration is a list of content types that your API treats as binary data\. Alternatively, you can set the [contentHandling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Integration.html#contentHandling) properties on the [Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Integration.html) and the [IntegrationResponse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_IntegrationResponse.html) resources\. The `contentHandling` value can be `CONVERT_TO_BINARY`, `CONVERT_TO_TEXT`, or undefined\. 

Depending on the `contentHandling` value, and whether the `Content-Type` header of the response or the `Accept` header of the incoming request matches an entry in the `binaryMediaTypes` list, API Gateway can encode the raw binary bytes as a base64\-encoded string, decode a base64\-encoded string back to its raw bytes, or pass the body through without modification\. 

You must configure the API as follows to support binary payloads for your API in API Gateway: 
+ Add the desired binary media types to the `binaryMediaTypes` list on the [RestApi](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_RestApi.html) resource\. If this property and the `contentHandling` property are not defined, the payloads are handled as UTF\-8 encoded JSON strings\.
+ Address the `contentHandling` property of the [Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Integration.html) resource\. 
  + To have the request payload converted from a base64\-encoded string to its binary blob, set the property to `CONVERT_TO_BINARY`\.
  + To have the request payload converted from a binary blob to a base64\-encoded string, set the property to `CONVERT_TO_TEXT`\.
  + To pass the payload through without modification, leave the property undefined\. To pass a binary payload through without modification, you must also ensure that the `Content-Type` matches one of the `binaryMediaTypes` entries, and that [passthrough behaviors](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md) are enabled for the API\. 
+ Set the `contentHandling` property of the [IntegrationResponse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_IntegrationResponse.html) resource\. The `contentHandling` property, `Accept` header in client requests, and your API's `binaryMediaTypes` combined determine how API Gateway handles content type conversions\. For details, see [Content type conversions in API Gateway](api-gateway-payload-encodings-workflow.md)\. 

**Important**  
When a request contains multiple media types in its `Accept` header, API Gateway honors only the first `Accept` media type\. If you can't control the order of the `Accept` media types and the media type of your binary content isn't the first in the list, add the first `Accept` media type in the `binaryMediaTypes` list of your API\. API Gateway handles all content types in this list as binary\.   
For example, to send a JPEG file using an `<img>` element in a browser, the browser might send `Accept:image/webp,image/*,*/*;q=0.8` in a request\. By adding `image/webp` to the `binaryMediaTypes` list, the endpoint receives the JPEG file as binary\.

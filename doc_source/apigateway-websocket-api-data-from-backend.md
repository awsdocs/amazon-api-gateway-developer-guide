# Sending data from backend services to connected clients<a name="apigateway-websocket-api-data-from-backend"></a>

API Gateway WebSocket APIs offer the following ways for you to send data from backend services to connected clients:
+ An integration can send a response, which is returned to the client by a route response that you have defined\.
+ You can use the `@connections` API to send a POST request\. For more information, see [Use `@connections` commands in your backend service](apigateway-how-to-call-websocket-api-connections.md)\.

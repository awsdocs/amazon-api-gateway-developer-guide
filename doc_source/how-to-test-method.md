Use the API Gateway console to test a REST API method\.

## Prerequisites<a name="how-to-test-method-prerequisites"></a>
+ You must specify the settings for the methods you want to test\. Follow the instructions in [Set up REST API methods in API Gateway](how-to-method-settings.md)\.

## Test a method with the API Gateway console<a name="how-to-test-method-console"></a>

**Important**  
Testing methods with the API Gateway console may result in changes to resources that cannot be undone\. Testing a method with the API Gateway console is the same as calling the method outside of the API Gateway console\. For example, if you use the API Gateway console to call a method that deletes an API's resources, if the method call is successful, the API's resources will be deleted\.

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\.

1. Choose a REST API\.

1. In the **Resources** pane, choose the method you want to test\.

1. In the **Method Execution** pane, in the **Client** box, choose **TEST**\. Type values in any of the displayed boxes \(such as **Query Strings**, **Headers**, and **Request Body**\)\. The console includes these values in the method request in default application/json form\.

   For additional options you may need to specify, contact the API owner\.

1. Choose **Test**\. The following information will be displayed:
   + **Request** is the resource's path that was called for the method\.
   + **Status** is the response's HTTP status code\.
   + **Latency** is the time between the receipt of the request from the caller and the returned response\.
   + **Response Body** is the HTTP response body\.
   + **Response Headers** are the HTTP response headers\.
**Tip**  
Depending on the mapping, the HTTP status code, response body, and response headers may be different from those sent from the Lambda function, HTTP proxy, or AWS service proxy\.
   + **Logs** are the simulated Amazon CloudWatch Logs entries that would have been written if this method were called outside of the API Gateway console\.
**Note**  
Although the CloudWatch Logs entries are simulated, the results of the method call are real\.

 For an additional tutorial with console images, see [Tutorial: Build a REST API with HTTP proxy integration](api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-http.md) in the tutorials and workshops section\. 

 In addition to using the API Gateway console, you can use AWS CLI or an AWS SDK for API Gateway to test invoking a method\. To do so using AWS CLI, see [test\-invoke\-method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/test-invoke-method.html)\.

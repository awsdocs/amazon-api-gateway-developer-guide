# Deploy a REST API in API Gateway<a name="set-up-deployments"></a>

 In API Gateway, a REST API deployment is represented by a [Deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Deployment.html) resource\. It's similar to an executable of an API that is represented by a [RestApi](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_RestApi.html) resource\. 

For the client to call your API, you must create a deployment and associate a stage with it\. A stage is represented by a [Stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html) resource\. It represents a snapshot of the API, including methods, integrations, models, mapping templates, and Lambda authorizers \(formerly known as custom authorizers\)\. When you update the API, you can redeploy the API by associating a new stage with the existing deployment\. We discuss creating a stage in [Setting up a stage for a REST API](set-up-stages.md)\.

## Create a deployment using the AWS CLI<a name="create-deployment-using-cli"></a>

When you create a deployment, you instantiate the [Deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Deployment.html) resource\. You can use the API Gateway console, the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the API Gateway REST API to create a deployment\. 

To use the CLI to create a deployment, use the create\-deployment command:

```
 aws apigateway create-deployment --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --region <region>
```

 The API is not callable until you associate this deployment with a stage\. With an existing stage, you can do this by updating the stage's [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html#deploymentId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html#deploymentId) property with the newly created deployment ID \(`<deployment-id>`\)\.

```
 aws apigateway update-stage --region <region> \
    --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> \ 
    --stage-name <stage-name> \ 
    --patch-operations op='replace',path='/deploymentId',value='<deployment-id>'
```

When deploying an API the first time, you can combine the stage creation and deployment creation at the same time:

```
 aws apigateway create-deployment --region <region> \
    --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> \
    --stage-name <stage-name>
```

This is what is done behind the scenes in the API Gateway console when you deploy an API the first time, or when you redeploy the API to a new stage\.

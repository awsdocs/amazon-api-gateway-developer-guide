## API Gateway quotas<a name="api-gateway-limits"></a>

Unless noted otherwise, the quotas can be increased upon request\. To request a quotas increase, you can use [Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/) or contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\.

 When authorization is enabled on a method, the maximum length of the method's ARN \(for example, `arn:aws:execute-api:{region-id}:{account-id}:{api-id}/{stage-id}/{method}/{resource}/{path}`\) is 1600 bytes\. The path parameter values \(whose size is determined at runtime\) can cause the ARN length to exceed the limit\. When this happens, the API client receives a `414 Request URI too long` response\. 

**Note**  
This limits URI length when resource policies are used\. In the case of private APIs where a resource policy is required, this limits the URI length of all private APIs\.

### API Gateway account\-level quotas<a name="apigateway-account-level-limits-table"></a>

The following quotas apply at the account level per Region in Amazon API Gateway\.


| Resource or operation | Default quota | Can be increased | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Throttle quota per Region across HTTP APIs, REST APIs, WebSocket APIs, and WebSocket callback APIs | 10,000 requests per second \(RPS\) with an additional burst capacity provided by the [token bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket), using a maximum bucket capacity of 5,000 requests\.  The burst quota is determined by the API Gateway service team based on the overall RPS quota for the account\. It is not a quota that a customer can control or request changes to\.  | Yes | 
| Number of Regional APIs | 600 | No | 
| Number of Edge\-optimized APIs | 120 | No | 

### HTTP API quotas<a name="http-api-quotas"></a>

Unless noted otherwise, the following quotas can be increased upon request\. To request an increase, you can contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\.

# Obtain permissions to create Amazon Cognito user pool authorizers for a REST API<a name="apigateway-user-pool-authorizer-permissions"></a>

To create an authorizer with an Amazon Cognito user pool, you must have `Allow` permissions to create or update an authorizer with the chosen Amazon Cognito user pool\. The following IAM policy document shows an example of such permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "apigateway:POST"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:apigateway:*::/restapis/*/authorizers",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "apigateway:CognitoUserPoolProviderArn": [
                        "arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:123456789012:userpool/us-east-1_aD06NQmjO",
                        "arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:234567890123:userpool/us-east-1_xJ1MQtPEN"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "apigateway:PATCH"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:apigateway:*::/restapis/*/authorizers/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "apigateway:CognitoUserPoolProviderArn": [
                        "arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:123456789012:userpool/us-east-1_aD06NQmjO",
                        "arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:234567890123:userpool/us-east-1_xJ1MQtPEN"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Make sure that the policy is attached to an IAM group that you belong to or an IAM role that you're assigned to\. 

In the preceding policy document, the `apigateway:POST` action is for creating a new authorizer, and the `apigateway:PATCH` action is for updating an existing authorizer\. You can restrict the policy to a specific region or a particular API by overriding the first two wildcard \(\*\) characters of the `Resource` values, respectively\. 

The `Condition` clauses that are used here are to restrict the `Allowed` permissions to the specified user pools\. When a `Condition` clause is present, access to any user pools that don't match the conditions is denied\. When a permission doesn't have a `Condition` clause, access to any user pool is allowed\.

You have the following options to set the `Condition` clause: 
+  You can set an `ArnLike` or `ArnEquals` conditional expression to permit creating or updating `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizers with the specified user pools only\. 
+  You can set an `ArnNotLike` or `ArnNotEquals` conditional expression to permit creating or updating `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizers with any user pool that isn't specified in the expression\. 
+  You can omit the `Condition` clause to permit creating or updating `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizers with any user pool, of any AWS account, and in any region\.

For more information on the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) conditional expressions, see Amazon [Resource Name Condition Operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_ARN)\. As shown in the example, `apigateway:CognitoUserPoolProviderArn` is a list of ARNs of the `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` user pools that can or can't be used with an API Gateway authorizer of the `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` type\.

# Setting Up Custom Domain Names for HTTP APIs<a name="http-api-custom-domain-names"></a>

*Custom domain names* are simpler and more intuitive URLs that you can provide to your API users\.

After deploying your API, you \(and your customers\) can invoke the API using the default base URL of the following format: 

```
https://api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/stage
```

where `api-id` is generated by API Gateway, `region` \(AWS Region\) is specified by you when creating the API, and `stage` is specified by you when deploying the API\.

The hostname portion of the URL \(that is, `api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com`\) refers to an API endpoint\. The default API endpoint can be difficult to recall and not user\-friendly\.

With custom domain names, you can set up your API's hostname, and choose a base path \(for example, `myservice`\) to map the alternative URL to your API\. For example, a more user\-friendly API base URL can become:

```
https://api.example.com/myservice
```

 If you don't set any base mapping under a custom domain name, the resulting API's base URL is the same as the custom domain \(for example, `https://api.example.com`\)\. In this case, the custom domain name can't support more than one API\. 

**Note**  
A custom domain can be associated with REST APIs and HTTP APIs\. You can use [API Gateway Version 2 APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/operations.html) to create and manage Regional custom domain names for REST APIs and HTTP APIs\.  
For HTTP APIs, TLS 1\.2 is the only supported TLS version\.

## Register a Domain Name<a name="http-api-custom-domain-names-register"></a>

You must have a registered internet domain name in order to set up custom domain names for your APIs\. If needed, you can register an internet domain using [Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/) or using a third\-party domain registrar of your choice\. An API's custom domain name can be the name of a subdomain or the root domain \(also known as "zone apex"\) of a registered internet domain\. 

After a custom domain name is created in API Gateway, you must create or update your DNS provider's resource record to map to your API endpoint\. Without such a mapping, API requests bound for the custom domain name cannot reach API Gateway\.

## Regional Custom Domain Names<a name="http-api-regional-custom-domain-names"></a>

When you create a custom domain name for a Regional API, API Gateway creates a Regional domain name for the API\. You must set up a DNS record to map the custom domain name to the Regional domain name\. You must also provide a certificate for the custom domain name\.

## Certificates for Custom Domain Names<a name="http-api-custom-domain-names-certificates"></a>

To provide a certificate for a custom domain name in a Region where ACM is supported, you must request a certificate from ACM\. To provide a certificate for a Regional custom domain name in a Region where ACM is not supported, you must import a certificate to API Gateway in that Region\. 

To import an SSL/TLS certificate, you must provide the PEM\-formatted SSL/TLS certificate body, its private key, and the certificate chain for the custom domain name\. Each certificate stored in ACM is identified by its ARN\. To use an AWS managed certificate for a domain name, you simply reference its ARN\. 

 ACM makes it straightforward to set up and use a custom domain name for an API\. You create a certificate for the given domain name \(or import a certificate\), set up the domain name in API Gateway with the ARN of the certificate provided by ACM, and map a base path under the custom domain name to a deployed stage of the API\. With certificates issued by ACM, you do not have to worry about exposing any sensitive certificate details, such as the private key\.

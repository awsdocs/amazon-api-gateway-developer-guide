# Configuring CORS for an HTTP API<a name="http-api-cors"></a>

[Cross\-origin resource sharing \(CORS\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser\.

CORS is typically required to build web applications that access APIs hosted on a different domain or origin\. You can enable CORS to allow requests to your API from a web application hosted on a different domain\. For example, if your API is hosted on `https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/` and you want to call your API from a web application hosted on `example.com`, your API must support CORS\.

If you configure CORS for an API, API Gateway automatically sends a response to preflight OPTIONS requests, even if there isn't an OPTIONS route configured for your API\. For a CORS request, API Gateway adds the configured CORS headers to the response from an integration\.

**Note**  
If you configure CORS for an API, API Gateway ignores CORS headers returned from your backend integration\.

You can specify the following parameters in a CORS configuration\.


| CORS headers | CORS configuration property | Example values | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Access\-Control\-Allow\-Origin  |  allowOrigins  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-cors.html)  | 
|  Access\-Control\-Allow\-Credentials  |  allowCredentials  |  true  | 
|  Access\-Control\-Expose\-Headers  |  exposeHeaders  |  Date, x\-api\-id  | 
|  Access\-Control\-Max\-Age  |  maxAge  |  300  | 
|  Access\-Control\-Allow\-Methods  |  allowMethods  |  GET, POST, DELETE, \*  | 
|  Access\-Control\-Allow\-Headers  |  allowHeaders  |  Authorization, \*  | 

## Configuring CORS for an HTTP API with a `$default` route and JWT authorizer<a name="http-api-cors-default-route"></a>

You can enable CORS and configure authorization for any route of an HTTP API\. When you enable CORS and authorization for the [`$default` route](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-routes.html#http-api-develop-routes.default), there are some special considerations\. The `$default` route catches requests for all methods and routes that you haven't explicitly defined, including `OPTIONS` requests\. To support unauthorized `OPTIONS` requests, add an `OPTIONS /{proxy+}` route to your API that doesn't require authorization and attach an integration to the route\. The `OPTIONS /{proxy+}` route has higher priority than the `$default` route\. As a result, it enables clients to submit `OPTIONS` requests to your API without authorization\. For more information about routing priorities, see [Routing API requests](http-api-develop-routes.md#http-api-develop-routes.evaluation)\.

## Configure CORS for an HTTP API by using the AWS CLI<a name="http-api-cors.example"></a>

You can use the following command to enable CORS requests from `https://www.example.com`\.

**Example**  

```
aws apigatewayv2 update-api --api-id api-id --cors-configuration AllowOrigins="https://www.example.com"
```

For more information, see [CORS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/apis-apiid.html#apis-apiid-model-cors) in the Amazon API Gateway Version 2 API Reference\.
